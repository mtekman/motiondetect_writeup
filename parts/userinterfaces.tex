\section{Widgets}

Widgets in Qt can be very difficult to work with, and certain common operations such as applying styles, or inserting images, or inserting animated gifs, or even getting the UI to slide from window to the next without getting dangling pointers can be slightly difficult to implement.

To find out how I overcame these problems please consult page~\pageref{widgetstuff} in the Other Implementation section of the Appendix.

\section{Window management and Maemo5 Stacked Windows}
Unlike iPhone and Android user interfaces, Maemo does not automatically slide between different windows when initiated, but instead creates a new window and shifts view to it, whilst the previous window still exists. 

This isn't much of a problem if the user is solely using the one app because the user will not notice it. However Maemo was one the first platforms to support multitasking windows for mobiles, and so if the user has multiple windows open at any one time, then switching between windows suddenly becomes tediousy difficult as there now many windows open at any one time.

One solution is to simply call QMainindow::hide() or QMainWindow::show() between different windows so that only one window is shown at any one time, but this is inelegant, and ultimately leads to confusion of how many windows are being hidden which can waste memory if those windows are not being used.

To overcome this I trawled through the forums and came across Maemo5StackedWindow. This is a window property that enables sliding transitions and works only on the Maemo5 device. To enable it one must place the following in the constructor in {\it every} window of the project:
\begin{lstlisting}
#ifdef Q_WS_MAEMO_5
    this->setAttribute(Qt::WA_Maemo5StackedWindow);
    this->setWindowFlags(Qt::Window);
#endif
\end{lstlisting}

This solves the sliding window transition problem and saves window space when multitasking. However it does still waste memory, since the window(s) that were switched from are still active, but just hidden.

To overcome this problem I implemented pointer control
\subsection{Pointer Control}
In Qt, when creating a new Window (or any object), one can create it by simply calling 'new MyWindow(this)'. The this is an optional argument given to all windows which simply refers the child Window to the parent via a pointer. The child can perform very limited operations upon the parent window such as hide() or show() mentioned previously, but usually it is not used very much.

But how can the parent control the child? By pointers. Instead of creating a new window and throwing into the memory, the parent creates a {\it pointer} to the child window so that it knows exactly where it is and what to do with it. This is shown by calling:
'MyWindow *point = new MyWindow(this)'.

So now the parent can delete the child at any time it wants by simply calling the delete command, forcing the child window to be destroyed. This may seem slightly evil, but it is neccesary. Consider the followin situation:
\begin{enumerate}
\item User opens app, MainWindow pops up
\item User wants to access Motion Detector, so they select it and the MotionDetectorWindow slides into view
\item User wants to change a Setting within MotionDetector, so they press the Settings button and the SettingWindow slides into view. We now have 3 windows open and active (MainWindow, MotionDetectorWindow, and SettingsWindow).
\item User finishes setting Settings, and goes back to MotionDetector. An eager developer may choose to delete the SettingsWindow at this point since it is not being of any use, however a cautios developer may reason that the user may want to change another setting in the nearby future and so it would be easier to keep SettingsWindow in memory to delete and recreate it.
\item User finishes with MotionDetector and goes back to MainWindow. Again, it would be unwise to delete MotionDetectorWindow just in case the user goes back into it, and so it should remain in memory (along with SettingsWindow) to enable ease of access.
\item User wants to use TimeLapse function, so they now click on Timelapse button instead of MotionDetector button, and TimeLapse button slides into view. At {\it this} point there are now 4 windows open (MainWindow, MotionDetectorWindow, SettingsWindow, TimeLapseWindow) which is a {\it waste of memory} because the user is unlikely to use the MotionDetector while they are using TimeLapse. It is at this stage that a developer should {\it delete MotionDetectorWindow and SettingsWindow}. This will leave just two windows open (MainWindow and TimeLapseWindow) and save memory.
\end{enumerate}
The key underlying logic here is that when the user chooses TimeLapse functionality, all MotionDetector windows and subwindows are deleted, and vice versa (when the user chooses MotionDetector functionality, all TimeLapse windows and subwindows are deleted).

This may seem complicated, but it is rather trivial. The command 'delete settingsPointer'  is embedded in the deconstructor for MotionDetectorWindow, so that when the motion detector is deleted, so is the Settings subwindow.

Likewise, when the TimeLapseWindow is closed, any of its subwindows are deleted by referencing the child pointers.
The implementation is shown below:\\
\begin{lstlisting}[title=Snippet from ChooseOp.cpp (MainWindow)]
//constructor, create Null pointers to motionwindow, and timelapsewindow
chooseop::chooseop(QWidget *parent=0){
    ...
    ui->setupUi();
    //Set pointers to both classes as 0 initially.
    mw = 0; tlw = 0;
}
//destructor removes dangling pointers
chooseop::~chooseop(){
    //Remove dangling pointers
    if(0!=mw) delete mw;
    if(0!=tlw) delete tlw;
    delete ui;
}
void chooseop::on_button_choose_watchdog_clicked(){
    if(0!=tlw)  {delete tlw; tlw = 0;} //If tlw is active, delete it and set pointer to null;
    if(0==mw){  //if not initialised, create new one and launch
        mw = new MotionWindow(this); 
        mw->showMaximized();
    }
    else if(0!=mw){ //already initialised; no need to create a new one
        mw->showMaximized();
    }
}
void chooseop::on_button_choose_timelapse_clicked(){
    if(0!=mw) {delete mw; mw = 0;} //if mw is active, delete it and set pointer to null;
    if(0==tlw){ //if not initialised, create new one and launch
        tlw = new TimeLapseWind(this);
        tlw->showMaximized();
    }
    else if(0!=tlw){ //already initalised
        tlw->showMaximized();
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Persisting data}
How does a developer share data between two different classes? One method is to make one class a child of another and then let the parent access data from the child by calling public its get() methods. This is a secure method of ensuring that data is accessible when requested (i.e. the pointer to the child is not null), but it makes it hard to share data between classes which share no heirarchy (or are of the same 'level').

On top of this one may want to the application to remember the settings the user set for the various widgets in the UI.

To get around this, we use QSettings.

\subsection{QSettings}
QSettings is Qt's implementation of providing persistent platform settings. QSettings writes a configuration file to ~/.config/appname/settingsname.ini which can preserve settings between application usage, but also has the hidden benefit that it enables different classes sharing no parent-child relationship to share data between them.

This may seem a small overhead of continuously reading and writing from disk, but it is far easier implementation that the alternative, which is to create duplicate  class variables so that for example; Class A with public variables vara,varb,varc, and Class B with public variables vara,varb,varc, and Class C with public variables vara,varb,varc. Say that ClassB has varb changed by the user, and Class C wants to access that setting. Now imagine the following implementation:\\
\Tree [ [ ClassB ClassC ].ClassA ]\\
So that in order to get from Class B to Class C, one must go through Class A first. Then the only way to persist that setting so that ClassA has varb changed too is to assign: 
\begin{lstlisting}
ClassA *apoint = new ClassA; 
ClassB *bpoint = new ClassB(apoint);
bpoint->varb = [changed by user];

//transfer setting from ClassB to C
apoint->varb = bpoint->varb;
delete bpoint;
ClassC *cpoint = new ClassC(apoint);
cpoint->varb = apoint->varb;
\end{lstlisting}
But this is clearly a waste of variables: ClassA is clearly a waypoint between ClassB and ClassC, and so does not utilize its own class variables, but merely uses them as a holder to pass variables between ClassB and ClassC.

One solution to this is to not delete bpoint until absolutely neccesary and directly assign ClassB to ClassC variables via:
\begin{lstlisting}
.. //as before

//transfer setting from ClassB to C
ClassC *cpoint = new ClassC(apoint);
cpoint->varb = bpoint->varb;
delete bpoint;
\end{lstlisting}
But this is only a solution for classes that are connected via the tree diagram defined previously.\\
For Classes that have more than one relationship between them such as:\\
\Tree [ [ [ [ ClassE ].ClassD ].ClassB [ ClassF ].ClassC ].ClassA ]\\
Then to persist data from ClassE to ClassF, one would have to go via E-D-B-A-C-F, meaning that the user must duplicate class variables for all classes and then assign ClassD.varb = ClassE.varb, ClassB.varb = ClassD.varb, and so forth deleting pointers each time. But this is a waste of duplicate class variables as before, since only ClassE and ClassF should be the only classes with duplicate variables.

To try my previous solution of not deleting pointers to until absolutely neccesary, would require me assigning ClassF.varb =  ClassE.varb directly, so long as I dont delete Classes E,D,B,A,C,F until the very end. This means that 6 windows would be taking up space in memory when only 2 are needed.

QSettings is the answer to this. The user simply commits settings to file in one class, and another class reads it at a later point without having duplicate variables or leave idle windows open.
It's implementation is simple:
\begin{lstlisting}
//Within ClassA
QSettings *setting = QSettings("Appname","Group");
setting.writeSetting("varb", this->varb);

//Within ClassB
QSettings *setting = QSettings("Appname","Group");
this>varb = setting.value("varb").toType();
\end{lstlisting}
It should be noted that QSettings wraps primitives with objects, and so the user must then convert them back to the relevant type when assigining them again.
